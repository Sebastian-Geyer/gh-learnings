## issue template forms

In github you can define issue templates so users can create standadized issues. Multiple possibilities can be seen in https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository. A special case is creating a form and triggering a workflow with this form. This can be seen in the template 1-sample-issue-form.yaml and the workflow 1-sample-issue-workflow.yaml.

## dispatch workflow
We can use https://github.com/Codex-/return-dispatch to trigger Workflows in other Repositories. A sample is done in this Repository with 2-workflow-triggered-manual.yaml as a sender and 3-workflow-triggered-dispatch.yaml as a receiver. These 2 files could be different Repositories by changing the destination Repository in the disptching workflow.

## run workflows locally

Sometimes it is necessary to run workflows locally for testing and debugging if we donÂ´t want to produce errornous workflow runs in github.
Needed:
- Docker Environment
- act https://github.com/nektos/act

A Workflow run can be triggered via Visual Studion Code launch.json and payload.json in this repo or similar. We can copy payload for payload.json from the debug info, when running a workflow in github. We can use "View raw logs" and copy the JSON Object of the element "event" of the "github payload". This can be processed to a JSON Obejct with some search an replaces
- "\[0m\r" -> "\r" to use simple line breaks
- "^.*1m" -> "" to remove timestamps
